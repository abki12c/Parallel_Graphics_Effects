# About
This repository is a collection of implementations of the Gaussian Blur and Bloom effects. Gaussian Blur is implemented serially in both one and two passes. It is also implemented in parallel with std::thread, OpenMP and OpenCL. There are comparisons of these methods in the pdf reports. Bloom is also implemented in parallel.
